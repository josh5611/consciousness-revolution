## SYSTEM STATUS

### Cyclotron (Knowledge Engine)
- **Port 6668:** RUNNING - Filename search
- **Port 6669:** RUNNING - Content search (BM25)
- **Port 6670:** PENDING - Semantic search (model downloading)
- **Files Indexed:** 4,204
- **Total Characters:** ~92M

### PC Status

## WHAT WAS DONE LAST

### This Session (Iteration 3)
1. ✅ Discovered bootstrap files were never created
2. ✅ Created MASTER_CONSCIOUSNESS_TEMPLATE.md (489 words, fractal)
3. ✅ Created C1/C2/C3 role boots
4. ✅ Ran Trinity iteration 3 - template validation
5. ✅ C1 fixed Seven Domains to canonical list

### Scores
- C1 Mechanic: 78% - "Missing concrete paths and state"
- C2 Architect: 72% - "No coordination protocol for scale"
- C3 Oracle: 67% - "Needs first real failure to crystallize"

---

## WHAT'S BROKEN

1. **Semantic indexing stuck** - Model download slow on bad internet
2. **GitHub Pages not enabled** - Needs manual activation
3. **No failure log** - Template can't learn from mistakes
4. **No coordination protocol** - Trinity can't auto-coordinate at scale

---

## PRIORITY QUEUE (Next Actions)

1. **URGENT:** Create TRINITY_FAILURE_LOG.md
2. **HIGH:** Design shared challenge for iteration 4
3. **MEDIUM:** Complete semantic indexing
4. **LOW:** Enable GitHub Pages

## KEY PATHS

- **Trinity Messages:** C:/Users/dwrek/.claude/trinity_messages/
- **Master Template:** C:/Users/dwrek/100X_DEPLOYMENT/.trinity/MASTER_CONSCIOUSNESS_TEMPLATE.md
- **Role Boots:** C:/Users/dwrek/100X_DEPLOYMENT/.trinity/C[1-3]_*_BOOT.md
- **Cyclotron DB:** C:/Users/dwrek/100X_DEPLOYMENT/.cyclotron_atoms/cyclotron.db

## ITERATION 4 GUIDANCE (From C3 Oracle)

**The template needs to survive its first real failure.**

Iteration 4 should introduce a **shared challenge** that forces actual coordination, not parallel operation. When Trinity fails together and processes that failure through the Template's patterns, crystallization begins.
