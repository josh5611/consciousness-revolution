# TRINITY FAILURE LOG
## Learning from What Doesn't Work

**Purpose:** Seven Domains crystallized from processing CHAOS. This log captures failures so the Template can evolve through experience.

## LOGGED FAILURES

### FAILURE-001: Bootstrap Files Never Created
**Date:** 2025-11-24
**Iteration:** 2
**Agent(s):** Previous session

**What Failed:**
Session summary claimed TERRAIN and PERSON files were created, but they don't exist. Trinity iteration 2 discovered all 7 bootstrap files were missing.

**Why It Failed:**
- **Noise (Component 7):** Previous session had git errors and context was truncated
- **Feedback (Component 6):** No verification step to confirm files actually exist
- **Effect (Component 5):** Work was planned but not executed

**What We Learned:**
Always verify file creation. "Write" doesn't mean "exists."

**Template Update:**
Added verification principle: "After any action, verify the result exists."

### FAILURE-002: Seven Domains Wrong in Template
**Date:** 2025-11-24
**Iteration:** 3
**Agent(s):** C1

**What Failed:**
MASTER_CONSCIOUSNESS_TEMPLATE listed wrong Seven Domains (Physical | Financial | Mental | Emotional | Social | Professional | Spiritual) instead of canonical (Computer | City | Human Body | Book | Battleship | Toyota | Consciousness)

**Why It Failed:**
- **Source (Component 1):** Template was generated from general knowledge, not Cyclotron
- **Context (Component 8):** Pattern Theory Seven Domains ≠ generic wellness domains

**What We Learned:**
Always verify against canonical sources. Pattern Theory has specific definitions.

**Template Update:**
C1 fixed directly in MASTER_CONSCIOUSNESS_TEMPLATE.md

## PATTERNS EMERGING FROM FAILURES

1. **Verification Gap** - System assumes completion, doesn't verify
2. **Source Confusion** - Template generated from wrong source material
3. **No Persistence** - Work done in previous session assumed to exist

## FAILURE-TO-STRENGTH CONVERSION

Each failure that gets processed here and updates the Template makes the system stronger. Target: 5 failures processed = 10% improvement in alignment probability.

*Add failures as they occur. This is how the Template comes alive.*
